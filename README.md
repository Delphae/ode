## Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)

Several Jupyter notebooks on ODE and the scipy odeint solver (IVP)

### Air drag problem<br>
For example the air drag problem of a baloon, based on the lecture of Walter Lewin (8.01x, lec. 12)<br>
MIT room 26-100, september 1999<br>
lecture notes http://freepdfhosting.com/8e7861f909.pdf<br>
In this lecture a 1st order nonlinear ODE has to be solved<br>
But this IVP problem can not be solved with analytic/exact calculus<br>
An excellent example for numerical computation with scipy<br>

### Airy function<br>
solve the 2nd order ODE<br>
y'' - (ax+b)y = 0 <br>
with substitution and the Airy functions<br>
