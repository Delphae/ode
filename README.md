Ordinary Differential Equations

Several Jupyter notebooks on ODE and the scipy odeint solver (IVP)

Air drag problem
For example the air drag problem of a baloon, based on the lecture of Walter Lewin (8.01x, lec. 12)<br>
MIT room 26-100, september 1999
lecture notes

In this lecture a 1st order nonlinear ODE has to be solved
But this IVP problem can not be solved with analytic/exact calculus
An excellent example for numerical computation with scipy

Airy function
solve the 2nd order ODE
y'' - (ax+b)y = 0
with substitution and the Airy functions
