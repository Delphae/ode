# ode
Ordinary Differential Equations

Several Jupyter notebooks on ODE and the scipy odeint solver (IVP)

For example the air drag problem, based on the lecture of Walter Lewin (8.01x, lec. 12)

In this lecture a 1st order nonlinear ODE has to be solved

But this IVP problem can not be solved with analytic/exact calculus

An excellent example for numerical computation with scipy
